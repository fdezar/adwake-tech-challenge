# Football API Full Stack App

This repository contains the code for Football API, a full-stack application built using MongoDB, Node, Angular and Typescript.

## Train of thought and decision making üß†

For this project, I chose MongoDB as the database due to its flexibility in handling complex, nested data structures such as players, teams, and leagues. Since football data can have hierarchical relationships (leagues containing teams, teams containing players), MongoDB‚Äôs document-oriented NoSQL model allows for easy storage and retrieval of this data without complex joins. Additionally, MongoDB scales easily, which is important for potential future expansion where more leagues, teams, and players could be added. Mongoose also helps us with the data relationships.

I always approach any project from a backend-first perspective. This means I see the backend as the fundamental foundation, and that implies developing it first before the client-side. The first thing I did in this case was to look for a model to structure the backend, identify the dependencies I might need, and from there, create the folder structure and install all the necessary dependencies.

Once the dependencies are installed, I usually tackle the server configuration and the models. I first make sure I have a clear understanding of what the database structure will look like, define it, and establish the relationships. This makes it easier for me to handle the routing system, as having the entire model system in place allows me to work on the routes, directly pointing to the specific models.

To test the routes, I always use Postman. Postman allows me to test routes without needing a frontend, which simplifies my work as a developer. I ensure that the routes work, and if they don‚Äôt, I usually check either the browser console or the terminal to see if there are any errors. I first try to fix them on my own, but if I can‚Äôt find the solution, I search for it online by copying and pasting the error or purely using my intuition.

Once I‚Äôm sure that the entire backend works perfectly, I move on to the frontend. In this case, Angular is a framework I had never worked with before, although I am more specialized in React. So my strategy has been to try to understand how to write the logic that I already know from React, in Angular. That is, how to create components, set up routing, apply JavaScript functions in the code, among other things. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that within the timeframe given for this project, it‚Äôs naturally very difficult to learn Angular from scratch. So instead of trying to learn all of Angular, I focused on learning the specific parts of Angular that this project required due to time constraints.

The styling of this application has been done with vanilla CSS. I am perfectly capable of using component libraries (I have projects in Bootstrap and Material UI, and I wouldn't have any issues learning things like Tailwind, for example), however, in this case, since it's a technical challenge, I thought it would be preferable to demonstrate that I have a solid understanding of the fundamentals without necessarily relying on libraries.

I hope this project demonstrates what I consider to be one of my strongest points: my adaptability and my ability to learn quickly.

## Features üí°

Front End

- League Selector functionality
- View league teams
- View team details and players of that team

Back End

- API endpoints for Football API requests
- MongoDB database for storing API data
- Mongoose models for defining data structures

## Technologies Used üíª

Front End

- Angular: JavaScript framework for building user interfaces
- Typescript: Programming language that adds static typing to JavaScript

Back End

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications
- Express: Web application framework for Node.js
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing data
- Mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js
- Typescript: Programming language that adds static typing to JavaScript

## Getting Started üöÄ

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. On the Server carpet, create a `.env` file and fill in the necessary environment variables (MONGODB_URI, FOOTBALL_API_KEY, PORT).
5. Start the server part using `npm run dev` and the client part using `npm run start`.

## Known Issues ‚ö†

- When importing data from the Football API on the server, for some unknown reason, sometimes it imports the data correctly, sometimes it only imports one team, and other times just a few. In theory, I have the correct links to the API, which makes me wonder if the issue is with my code or with the Free version of the API, which might limit the downloads.

- There's a problem with the rigidity of the database, as some teams or players do not have all the parameters. According to the exercise instructions, all parameters were required, and I have implemented it that way. However, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that this approach causes errors in the code, as there are parameters like dateOfBirth, position, etc., or even entire teams without players, that trigger errors in the code.

- Due to the previous issue, I have commented out the console.log statements instead of deleting them, in case you'd like to see the errors for yourselves.

- There are some teams that have incorrect competition IDs for the leagues they belong to, for some unknown reason. For example, FC Barcelona appears in the Bundesliga because the competition association that shows up in my database is mistakenly the Bundesliga. I‚Äôm not sure if this is an error in my code or an issue with the API.

- The server deployment works fine, and I have configured it successfully. However, despite my multiple attempts to configure the front-end deployment, it seems that I‚Äôm missing something, which causes it not to work. It appears that the deployment configuration for Angular is different from React, and for now, I haven't been able to find the right one. I'm unsure whether fixing this bug would take hours or days (with React, it took me days to figure it out, even with the help of a senior). In any case, I believe it goes beyond the expected time frame for completing this tech challenge.
